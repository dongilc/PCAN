Some features listed in the PCANBasic documentation (Windows version) are not available within Linux PCANBasic API. 

- Timestamps on Linux are the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the epoch: the epoch is the point in time of 00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970.

- The following parameters will return PCAN_ERROR_ILLPARAMTYPE (0x4000, 16384) with the CAN_GetValue/CAN_SetValue functions: 
	* PCAN_5VOLTS_POWER
	* PCAN_CHANNEL_IDENTIFYING (CAN_GetValue only)
	* PCAN_IP_ADDRESS
	* PCAN_LAN_SERVICE_STATUS

- The following parameters has a slightly different behaviour/usage than the one described in the Windows documentation:
	* PCAN_CHANNEL_IDENTIFYING: with PCAN Linux Driver >=8.10, CAN_SetValue will be blocked while the LED blinks for 5 seconds (except with value PCAN_PARAMETER_OFF/0x00).
	* PCAN_CHANNEL_VERSION: CAN_GetValue requires an initialized channel. Otherwise PCAN_ERROR_INITIALIZE is returned.
	* PCAN_RECEIVE_EVENT: CAN_SetValue will return PCAN_ERROR_ILLOPERATION as the feature is enabled by default.
	* PCAN_BUSSPEED_NOMINAL: required buffer size is 64 bits long.
	* PCAN_BUSSPEED_DATA: required buffer size is 64 bits long.
